title: dark mode - "maximal" approach
---

This is not implemented but it obviously could be.

Problems with this approach:

* Superficially resembles output format but is actually much more complicated (light and dark divs contain `.cell .cell-output-display`)
* Where does nonplot content go?
  * echo of code
  * stdout
  * stderr
* These problems could be solved but it's messy
